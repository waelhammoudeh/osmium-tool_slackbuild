The Osmium-tool

This is the README file for osmium-tool slackware build script.

Osmium is a command line tool for working with OpenStreetMap data files.

Files and scripts are updated to build osmium vesion 1.18.0 on August 4/2025
    
Required packages

  1) Pandoc package to build man pages if detected by cmake.

  2) nlohmann_json from https://slackbuils.org

You can find osmium manual at: (https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/manual.html).
You can (should) download the manual if you do not install pandoc.

Pandoc I used an old script I found on www.linuxquestions.org slackware
forum written by "LQ Guru dugan"; see the thread at:

  "https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/
   installing-pandoc-on-current-x86_64-the-easy-way-4175620166/"

(above url is one line broken into 2; combine into ONE line please)
and the source mentioned in the thread is: "https://pandoc.org/installing.html"
The file I downloaded was: "pandoc-2.11-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
So change the version number and fix file name to match whatever file you
download and then install the package.

If you used my previous script; then please remove protozero and libosmium
packages before building the new osmium-tool package.

A little bash script is provided to download all three required files, please
use the script for the download since it renames files to the expected names
by the SlackBuild script! And I hope it makes your life easier.
