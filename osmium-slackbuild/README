The Osmium-tool

This is the README file for osmium-tool slackware build script.

Osmium is a command line tool for working with OpenStreetMap data files.

Required Packages:
    protozero version 1.6.3 or later
    Libosmium version 2.16.0 or later
    
Optional Pandoc package to build man pages if detected by cmake.

You can find osmium manual at: (https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/manual.html).
You can (should) download the manual if you do not install pandoc.

Pandoc I used an old script I found on www.linuxquestions.org slackware
forum written by "LQ Guru dugan"; see the thread at:
  "https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/
   installing-pandoc-on-current-x86_64-the-easy-way-4175620166/"
(above url is one line broken into 2; combine into ONE line please)
and the source mentioned in the thread is: "https://pandoc.org/installing.html"
The file I downloaded was: "pandoc-2.11-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
So change the version number and fix file name to match whatever file you
download and then install the package.

Enjoy :)
