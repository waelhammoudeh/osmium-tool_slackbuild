# osm_osmium-tool_slackbuild
README_REPO

Osmium is a multipurpose command line tool for working with OpenStreetMap
data files based on the Osmium library.

This repository has Slackware build script for the osmium tool. There is only
one SlackBuild script here now - I had three!

If you are upgrading from my earlier version, please remove protozero and
libosmium packages before building this new osmium-tool version. Also please
use the provided "download-sources.sh" script to get all needed three files.
